# Fuel Race

Players use controls to manipulate acceleration and velocity of their ship, with the goal of not running out of fuel or health. Player users fuel every time they click a button. Health is depleted by falling off map or taking fire from other players. Battle your friends in a fun race for resources. 

Coded in a Python based framework called PyGame.
